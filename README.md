# Akashic
## Introduction

The world is currently witnessing the highest levels of displacement on record. The stories and experiences of the dispossessed, particularly refugees, are often lost, untold, or forgotten, creating a void in our collective memory and understanding of these crises. Akashic aims to address this issue by providing a digital sanctuary for the oppressed and dispossessed to share their stories and be remembered.

## Project Overview

Akashic is a groundbreaking initiative that seeks to create a digital archive to permanently store, preserve, and organize memories, stories, and cultural knowledge of refugees. By leveraging the power of decentralized storage solutions like IPFS and Filecoin, Akashic will ensure that these narratives remain accessible, immutable, and resistant to censorship. This project aligns with Filecoin's mission to become a public record for humanity, by enshrining the stories of the most vulnerable cultures and populations on earth.

## Benefits

Akashic will provide numerous benefits to refugees, researchers, policymakers, and society as a whole:

1. **Empowerment**: Refugees will have a platform to share their experiences, ensuring their voices are heard and their stories are not forgotten.
2. **Preservation**: The use of decentralized storage will ensure that these narratives are preserved for future generations, even in the face of political instability or censorship attempts.
3. **Empathy and Understanding**: By presenting these narratives, Akashic fosters empathy and understanding, humanizing statistics and abstract concepts, informing more effective and compassionate responses to refugee crises.
4. **Cultural Heritage**: Akashic will serve as a repository for the cultural heritage of displaced communities, helping to maintain their identity and connection to their roots.

## Functionality and Features

Akashic will offer a range of features to facilitate the collection, curation, and presentation of refugee stories:

1. **Story Submission**: Contributors can submit stories anonymously or self-identified, along with geolocation data. The platform will accept a wide range of media formats, including audio, video, and written accounts.
2. **Story Curation**: Submitted stories will undergo a two-step process of filtering and curation into thematic collections. Professional staff and reputation-based groups will ensure the selection of compelling, high-quality content.
3. **Story Exhibition**: Curated collections will be transformed into immersive exhibitions, with each story represented as an on-chain NFT or hypercert. Patrons can explore these exhibitions in 3D gallery spaces and contribute to the works by purchasing a portion of the hypercert.
4. **Partnerships**: Akashic will collaborate with organizations like the Internet Archive for long-term preservation, MonaVerse for creating virtual exhibition spaces, and Artizen for tokenization and provenance tracking of exhibited works.

## Technology

Akashic will be built on a robust technical infrastructure:

1. **IPFS and Filecoin**: Decentralized storage solutions will ensure the long-term preservation and accessibility of the archived content.
2. **User-friendly Interface**: A mobile-optimized web interface will allow easy access for contributors, curators, and patrons.
3. **Blockchain Integration**: NFTs and hypercerts will be used to represent and track the provenance of exhibited works, while digital wallets will enable self-identification and authentication.
